<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# The App's Purpose
This full-stack MERN application is a single-page application (SPA) resource for those wish to stay fit and healthy! Deployed and hosted on Heroku, the website offers the user the ability to create a profile, review basic workout statistics, the option to plan a workout, or meal plan. In the case of planning a workout, once scheduled the workout will be visible on their in-app calendar page. A user can also log their miles ran or miles cycled in chart form, and see the chart update in real-time.
	
# Under the Hood
This app features a React.js-powered frontend-facing UI, with Bootstrap CSS framework for mobile-first, responsive design. The API is consumed thanks to a Node.js\/Express.js\/GraphQL backend which powers all the routes. The database features NoSQL-based MongoDB paired with Mongoose object-document mapper (ODM) for storing database documents and creating schema and models. React-date-picker is implemented for the calendar, and Apex charts for displaying workout statistics. We used Git for a version control tool. The app was developed with the following frameworks, libraries, or tools:
